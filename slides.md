## Agenda
- Intro on VM hypervisor

- NoHype: remove the hypervisor

- NOVA: minimize the hypervisor

- Conclusion



## Hypervisor
It **emulates** a given hardware and mislead the guest OS to run directly on it.

It usually needs a large and complex pice of code and frequent interactions with the guest OS.

A **VM exits** is generated by the vCPU when some operation done by the gust OS need the intervention of the hypervisor.




## Security thread in virtualisation
Hyprvisors have to maintain isolation between the different VMs, both toward each other and to the host.

There are been cases in which, through an hypervisor vulnerability, an attacker can exit the virtual machine.

Usually hypervisors have a big TCB.



## NoHype
It takes the approach of eliminating the hypervisor attack surface altogether.

It removes the need for VMs to constantly interact with the hypervisor during their lifetime.



## Main Design
- Pre-allocating Memory and Cores

- Using only Virtualized I/O Devices

- Short-Circuiting the System Discovery

- Avoiding Indirection



## Pre-allocating Memory and Cores
Without hypervisor is not possible to dynamically allocate memory and computational resources.

It fix the memory allocation and the cores before the VM start.



## Using only Virtualized I/O Devices
Without hypervisor is not possible to emulate I/O devices.

It can use or dedicated I/O device or device with virtualisation technology.

The only true indispensable I/O device in the cloud is the NIC card because the storage device can be access through the network.



## Short-Circuiting the System Discovery
The guest OS do not have to run discovery call on the hardware during the execution, because there is no hypervisor to answer them.

To achieve that they modify the kernel of the guest OS, so that those operations are executed only at boot time and the answer cached.



## Avoiding Indirection
The hypervisors use indirection to modified the process ID of the process inside the guest OS in so that they start counting from 0.

With noHype and the static allocation of the core to the VM, each of them can access the correct process avoiding indirection.

For the some reason they also remove the re-route of the interrupts.



## Prototype Design
![img](img/NoHype-four_stage.png)

Hypervisor: *Xen 4.0*, Guest OS: *Linux 2.6.35.4*, CPU: *Intel XEON W5580*, NIC card controller: *Intel 82576*


## VM Creation
The Xen hypervisor manage the initialization of the VM:

- set the affinity of the core

- set the NIC by a PCI pass through

- set the memory allocation using VT-d


## VM Bootup
There are three main phase:

- load the kernel and the initial RAM disk using the network.

- run the modified Linux kernel (discovery devices)

- disengagement of the hypervisor

- mount the iSCSI HD drive

- start user code execution

note:
iSCSI: Internet Small Computer Systems Interface, an Internet Protocol (IP)-based storage networking standard for linking data storage facilities. In a nutshell, it provides block-level access to storage devices over a TCP/IP network.


## VM Shutdown
They configure the controller structure (VMCS) of the CPU to exit the VM mode when it receive a NMI interruption.

This also give the possibility to the VM of handling the exit signal and shutdown it correctly.



## Problems of this approach
<div style="font-size: 25px;">

- Static allocation of the resources is an important limitation for VM managements (i.e. no more that one VM per core). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- The virtualisation layer could no longer be used for interposition, which is necessary for live migration, memory sharing and compression, and security enhancements (i.e. cpu interruption DoS). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- It still trusts the VM management software. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Requires changes on the existing hardware and virtualisation stack. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- It only considers software attacks and cannot guard against inspecting a VM disk, bus snooping and memory freezing. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- The modified Kernel on the Guest can introduce incompatibility with the user software or new vulnerability. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Without indirection guest can easily know to be inside a VM <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
On the software side, NoHype [21, 22] advocates space-partitioning cores, memory and devices to a VM, detaching the virtualization layer during a VMâ€™s normal execution time. This reduces the attack surfaces for a VM as the VM is physically isolated from other VMs as well as the management VM for most of the time. Compared to NoHype, HyperCoffer assumes a stronger adversary model that further considers physical attacks, while NoHype only considers software attacks and cannot guard against sophisticated attacks such as inspecting a VM disk, bus snooping and memory freezing. Further, HyperCoffer still retains most functionalities in a commercial hypervisor like time-multiplexing resources, which are currently absent in NoHype.

NoHype [31] tries to address the trustworthiness of multi-tenant
clouds by removing the virtualization layer during execution. However,
removing the virtualization layer may also lose some useful
features such as sharing resources across multiple VMs, which are
key features of multi-tenant clouds. Further, NoHype still trusts the
VM management software and requires changes to existing hardware
and virtualization stack and there is no available implementation
of such a system.

NoHype [23] advocates removing the hypervisor altogether, using
static partitioning of CPUs, memory, and peripherals among VMs.
This would allow a host to be shared by multiple operating systems,
but with none of the other benefits of virtualization. In particular, the
virtualization layer could no longer be used for interposition, which
is necessary for live migration [13], memory sharing and compression
[19, 32], and security enhancements [11, 30, 46, 16].



## NOVA
It is a micro-hypervisor that minimizes the amount of code in the privileged hypervisor.

The main features are:

- it implements the virtualisation at user level.

- It reduces the TCB of the VM by at least an order of magnitude.



## Line of code
![img](img/NOVA-graph.png)



## Design
![img](img/NOVA-architecture.png)

It uses the design principle of the least privilege among the components.



## Micro-hypervisor
It implements a capability-based hypercall interface

**Capabilities** are opaque and immutable to the user, they cannot be inspected, modified, or addressed directly.

It is possible to **delegates** copies of the capability with the same or reduced permissions to other domains that require access to the object.

note:
The use of capabilities leads to fine-grained access control.


## Micro-hypervisor objects
The main features of the kernel are implemented with the following objects:

- Protection domains

- Execution contexts

- Scheduling contexts

- Portals

- Semaphores

note:
- protection domains: it is a resource container that implement spatial isolation, and abstract the different between a VM and a user application.

- execution contexts: are the activities inside a protection domain, and they abstract between thread and virtual CPU.  They can execute program code, manipulate data, and use portals to send messages to other execution contexts.

- scheduling contexts:  it couple a time quantum with a priority and ensure that no execution context can monopolize the CPU.

- portals: are used to communicate between protected domain, ensuring a cross domain channel.

- semaphores: facilitate the synchronization between execution context on the same or different process. The hypervisor use it to signal the occurrence of hardware interruption.



## Root Partition Manager
It manages all the memory regions, I/O ports, and interrupts of the system.

It is the first protected domain created by the micro-hypervisor after boot and it can create and delegate new protected domain to assign resources.



## Virtual Machine Monitor
It supports the execution of an unmodified guest OS in the VM, emulating sensitive instructions and providing virtual devices.

It runs as a user-level application and there is one for each VMs.



## Problem of the NOVA approach
<div style="font-size: 26px;">

- It do not provide the rich set of features necessary for deployment in commercial hosting environments. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- They had to remove a large hardware support to achieve the reduction of the TCB. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- They assume that and attacker can not violate the booting sequence. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- The micro-hypervisor is still in charge of complex management duties like address space management, interrupt and exception handling, and communication between the running workloads. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
<!--TODO: controllare questa affermazione!-->

- The reduction of the LOCs in the hypervisor not imply that formal verification methods can apply. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- The use of a VMM for each VM reduce the risk of damaging other VMs but does not reduce the possibility to attack the hypervisor kernel. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

note:
NOVA [60] is micro-kernel based VMM that decouples the traditional monolithic VMM into a component-based system, and improves security by introducing capability-based access control for different components in a VMM. The security of the management software in However, these systems aim at protecting the virtualization layer from external attacks to the VM stack, but without considering possible attacks that leverage legal maintenance operations from the cloud operators, which is a new requirement in multi-tenant cloud.

However, these approaches mostly only protect
VMMs from attacks from a malicious guest VM, without consider-
203
ation of preventing an operator with control of management tools
and control VM from tampering with or stealing usersâ€™ confidential
data, especially external storage such as virtual disks. Further, they
require changes to the core parts of a VMM [68] or even a complete
reconstruction of VMMs [31, 60], thus may pose a notable

For example, they cannot defend against attacks leveraging
legal maintenance operations such as dump/clone/migrate a VM or
virtual disks. Further, they require a reconstruction of the cloud
software stack. To this end, it is critical to provide multi-tenant
cloud with an approach that defending against attackers penetrated
through the three attack surfaces from tampering with tenant VMs,
yet with a small trusted computing base, which motivates the design
and implementation of CloudVisor.

In this vein, from-scratch
hypervisors [38, 40, 42] have shown that particular security properties
can be achieved by rearchitecting the platform, but they do not
provide the rich set of features necessary for deployment in commercial
hosting environments.

More recently, NOVA [42]
uses a similar architecture and explicitly partitions the TCB into
several user-level processes within the hypervisor. Although capable
of running multiple unmodified OSes concurrently, the removal
of the control VM and requirement for NOVA-specific drivers sacrifice
hardware support for TCB size. Also, it is far from complete:
it cannot run Windows guests and has limited toolstack support.

To our knowledge, most of the other SRTM-based
approaches assume that the attacker is unable to violate the
integrity of the booting process (e.g. NOVA [35] explicitly
claims so). However, the boot chain nowadays can be com-
plex and repetitive. For example, GRUB 2 [14] nowadays
contains âˆ¼200K LOCs in total and even GRUB Legacy con-
tains âˆ¼10K LOCs as its core components. Some of the ini-
tialization duties of the bootloader have already be carried
out by the BIOS and will later be covered again by the
VMM. It can largely decrease the TCB size if we merge
them together into the BIOS and remove unnecessary boot
procedures.

There are some approaches directly dividing VMM into
separated components with different privileges. NOVA [35]
constructs a microkernel-based VMM that is âˆ¼9K LOCs in
size. Despite its thin TCB compared to commodity hypervi-
sors, the complexity of TCB is not markedly decreased since
the microhypervisor is still in charge of complex manage-
ment duties like address space management, interrupt and
exception handling, and communication between the run-
ning workloads. So the thin TCB is still difficult to be se-
cured and verified dynamically. Although seL4 [21] pro-
poses a technique to formally verify a microkernel with
âˆ¼8.7K LOCs, it imposes several restrictions on the micro-
kernel functionality. Thus a verifiable microhypervisor re-
mains impractical so far. Other than microkernel-based sys-
tems, VMM Disaggregation [30] also shrinks the TCB size
by moving some VMM components out of the privileged do-
main. However, the TCB size is still too large for dynamic
protection.



## Conclusions
The Virtual Machine are one of the most important component of the Cloud and so their security is very important. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

The hypervisor have to improve their security and reliable but either the approach of the NOVA and the one of NoHype are to drastic to be actually implemented in real life. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
